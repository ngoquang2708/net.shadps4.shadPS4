     <p>shadPS4 is an early PlayStation 4 emulator for Windows, Linux and macOS written in C++.</p>
+    <p>For ease of use, this Flatpak distribution of shadPS4 bundles the latest stable release
+      of the emulator with the official shadPS4 Qt Launcher as a GUI front-end. The launcher in
+      the Flatpak distribution is pre-set to use the bundled emulator and cannot download or run
+      other versions. If you want the ability to select different versions of shadPS4, please
+      download the AppImage release from the shadPS4 website instead.</p>
     <p>The emulator is still early in development, so don't expect a flawless experience. Nonetheless, the emulator can already run a number of commercial games.</p>
